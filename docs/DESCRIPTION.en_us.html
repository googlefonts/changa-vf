Changa is a typeface family intended for headlines, titles and other display settings and supports the Latin and Arabic scripts.
</p>
<p>
The Latin was developed with a singular height so that you can create display texts with minimum line spacing.
The lowercase has short ascenders and descenders and the letters are inscribed within a square. 
The uppercase is also sturdy and squat. 
The counter shapes are rectangular, featuring small curves in opposite vertexes which accompany and break the shapes, evoking a contemporary style.

The Arabic was also drawn by Eduardo Tunni (in Buenos Aires) in collaboration with M. Gaber (in Cairo.)

The Changa project is led by Eduardo Tunni, a type designer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
